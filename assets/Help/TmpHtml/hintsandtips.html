<p><span class=rvts102>This section is meant to help you step your game up, in order to hopefully have your name be displayed on the high scores page for the entire world to see. It is also for those having a little trouble with the game, and wish to better their skills. Either way, here are some tips and tricks developed in house. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104>Use the multi jump wisely: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>Not every scenario will call for a multi jump, in many cases the locations were you think you need to multi jump were created for you to swim too high and fail the level. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104>Jumping isn't your only option: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>In many spots throughout the game, jumping over an obstacle may seem like the best way about it. In reality however, more often than not the more efficient way to proceed is to go through the obstacle. By doing this you can ensure that you don't risk jumping too high, or falling too low, resulting in a failed level. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104>The first path you see is not always the only one (or best one): </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>While going through the levels you may see what appears to be the only way to get through an obstacle. This is not usually the case, as the maps are build for there to be multiple paths for you to reach the same endpoint (with some exceptions of course). We here at </span><span class=rvts116>3AM Productions </span><span class=rvts102>challenge you to look for these alternate paths, and who knows, they might just be your ticket on to the high scores board. </span></p>

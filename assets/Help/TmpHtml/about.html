<p><span class=rvts118>About </span><span class=rvts119>3AM Productions</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts116>3AM Productions </span><span class=rvts102>is a small studio run by two friends from Toronto, Ontario. Together their mission is to create a fun and educative game, as well as survive their AP Computer Science course! </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts116>Hernando Castano - Developer &amp; Project Lead </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>Raised in a small outback village on the plains of Central Colombia, Hernando made his first "Hello World" program using only sticks and rocks. He now spends his days using the new fancy-shmancy Windows 8.1, and making "Hello World" programs in others languages such as </span><span class=rvts116>Ruby</span><span class=rvts102> and </span><span class=rvts116>JavaScript</span><span class=rvts102>. When he's not programming, Hernando likes to spend his days counting down to the end of AP Computer Science (for bragging rights of course!).</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts116>Ansh Juneja - Developer &amp; Spokesperson </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>A simple minded fellow, with a desire to program, Ansh spends his nights curled up in front of his computer running countless tests on Dr.Java in hopes to get a good product out to the public. As a child in Delhi, he had to walk uphill both to and from school, this lead to him become the strong and bold character he is today. </span></p>

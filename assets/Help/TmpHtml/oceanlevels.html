<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>It is here that you will experience the familiar platform style game, and where most of the 'actual' gameplay will take place. There are several levels, each bringing along a different gaming experience. Good luck getting through all of them, as some can be really tricky! </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104>Traversing the Oceans </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>Like any other turtle, Felix will be swimming through the ocean like it's nobody's business. But here are some ins and outs you should know before giving the ocean levels a go. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>Throughout the various levels you will find many platforms and structures which you will be able to run into aimlessly, or use to get around. You can stand on tiles, jump on tiles, and run into tiles. However, you cannot jump through tiles, so you'll have to take the scenic route if you missed your jump onto a long platform. </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts107>Felix standing on a platform </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>The game includes various tiles, each used in different parts of the game. Here are some of the tiles you can expect to find scattered throughout the oceans. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>

<p><span class=rvts104>FelixOutOfBoundsException </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>There are four ways to lose in the game, two of which will be discussed in this section. Both of these ways involve Felix going 'out of bounds', by either dropping too low in the map, or going too high. These two scenarios can be thought of as occurring as soon as Felix leaves the game panel. In reality there is a little wiggle room, but you should still try and avoiding reaching the extremities.If you do end up going out of bounds, you will be taken back to the word search. From there you can choose to redo the level, or try another one. </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts104>Your Goal </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>When you are inside the ocean levels, your goal is to collect all the 'Clue' tiles found scattered through the level. The 'Clue' tiles look like this: </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>

<p><span class=rvts108><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts107>A Clue Tile</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>When all the clue tiles are found, the you have successfully completed the level. You will be taken back to the word search to continue your journey! </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104>Your Enemy</span></p>
<p><span class=rvts104><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>While you're on your hunt for those sweet looking 'Clue' tiles, you also need to be careful and do your best to avoid the 'Skull' tile. Touch one of those bad boys are your fun is over! </span></p>

<p><span class=rvts123>Watch</span><span class=rvts104> the Time </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>You last major enemy in the game is time itself. Each level has a certain amount of time for completion. If you cannot finish the level in the allotted time, your run will end and you will be taken back to the word search. </span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102><br></span></p>
<p><span class=rvts102>You can check how much time you have with the sidebar. There, you will be able to see useful information such as the time you have remaining, the amount of clue tiles you need in order to finish the level, and how many achievement tiles you have collected so far. </span></p>
